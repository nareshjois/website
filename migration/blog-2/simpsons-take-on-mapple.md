I have been a simpsons fan ever since it started airing, my hard disk is full of episodes right from season 1 , i like how the creator Matt has been able to keep the show alive even after so many seasons you would still laugh. This time simpsons take on apple or mapple, I realy like the bart simpson part at the first video's end when he mocks steve jobs by saying that he has cheated crowd out of money and has invested that in microsoft .. Watch and have a laugh.
