The Movie is based on the New York Times bestseller of the same name which is a dramatization of the Operation Red Wings which was a failed operation in which 4 US Navy Seals on a  reconnaissance and surveillance mission gets ambushed. and as the name suggests only one person comes out. 
While you already know the outcome, there is never a moment in the movie where you are not on the edge of your seat, The movie depicts killing , blood and gore in all its glory. You start to feel for the soldiers, Some part of you even wants to get violent and start killing the enemy. I have never been a big fan of violence being gloriefied, and the point was pushed hard and certain, 
> War is Bad, People getting killed in war is horrific

Peter Berg who helms the directors' cap has made sure that the story was given justice.
All the lead actors 
Mark Wahlberg as Marcus Luttrell, 
Taylor Kitsch as Lieutenant Michael P Murphy,
Emile Hirsch as Danny Dietz
Ben Foster as Matthew Axelson,
Eric Bana as Lieutenant Commander Erik S. Kristensen,
are committed to the plot, there is very little room for them to wriggle around anyway.

Without giving away too much of plot, the story also has some redeeming qualities about people. 
With That said, War is still Bad.
The Opening and Closing Credits are both worth a complete watch.

People Shut the F*** up when you come to watch a movie. I don't want running commentary about the movie or your life. I will personally get violent and kick you in the balls.
