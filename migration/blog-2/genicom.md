I would recommend everyone to log on to this site and start your family tree, If you are the kind of person who actually started creating family tree in offline software and found yourself at a dead end, this is amazing piece of software, yes there were others like this out there, but this one looks promising, It is still in its beta and has its quirks but I would certainly recommend supporting this site which will make this site even better, One great feature is if you invite your family member, they can start entering with them as the center of the tree.

P.S: On more of a personal note, I entered 138 members of my family and I was actually amazed that I knew so many people.
