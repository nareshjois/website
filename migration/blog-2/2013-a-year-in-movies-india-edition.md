Following up on my previous post, here is the India edition, while I did not watch as many movies on Big Screen, I streamed them, (I agree that does not contribute to the industry - but hey, I did watch quite a lot)

The First one is real close to me as it is in Kannada. 

## Lucia

The movie was crowd funded and was touted as an experiment, but boy is it good. The story of the movie is not that great (you can see references of the movies from which it has borrowed Ideas from), but the narration was absolutely brilliant, the movie manages to keep the audience caputed in the movie till the end which is so hard to come by these days. The movie revolves around the idea of Lucid dreaming on which a lot of movies have been made, but may the first time the execution is good. The parallel storytelling of the charecter lead living his real and dreamworld is wonderful. Pawan Kumar (Director) truly delivers on direction and will be a director to watch out for. (Too much of expecations riding on him)
>This movie has given hope to me that the Kannada Film Industry is capable of producing good movies like the ones in the golden era that has passed by. Its more than just midless movie that the industry is churning out.

The movie is already set to be re-made in Hindi, and Pavan Kumar himself is set to direct the movie. Here's to hoping that he and the movie gets the attention it deserved.

Shoojit Sarkar's Direction based around Rajiv Gandhi's Assasination was one of the best movies i have seen all year, While some creative licenses were taken around the stroy, the narration was quite good. Though inevitibly you know how the movie is going to end, it still manages to keep  the audience holding out their breath, If you ask, Is this the best movie I might say no but given movies that were release this one is the leader of the pack.

Spcial 26 is Neeraj Pandey's next after Wednesday, the expection were high and the movie did manage to deliver quite a bit. Though set with a completely different tone, the movie was done very well, Just take out the Romance angle inside and you almost got a perfect movie.
