I do remember a lot of time ago i wrote a post about how to an mid range Vista Premium system for under 50K well now I got my home one for around 50% of that amount.

My new configuration is

* AMD Athlon64 X2 5200+
* 2 GB DDR2, 800 MHz RAM
* ASUS A8N-VM (AMD 690G) Motherboard with onboard DVI output
* 320GB SATA HDD 7200RPM
