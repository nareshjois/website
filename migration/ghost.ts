Mound P is a bisymmetric, bunker-like feature          accompanied by an elevated hexagon, whereas Mound E appears to be a weathered five-sided pyramid, not unlike the much larger City Pyramid, which is perched atop a shallow buried square.

If so, the hypothesized “Martians” who constructed the Face may be our relatives. For if lifeforms are indeed capable of hitching rides between planets, then life on Earth could have Martian ancestry, or Martian life could have terrestrial ancestry. Or Mars and Earth could host life that was originally foreign to both planets.\\nTheoretically, panspermia could even accelerate evolution on a recipient planet by importing new DNA sequences, or even simple organisms.          The idea of bio-friendly planets being genetically jump-started threatens the prevailing wisdom that Mars was not “alive long enough” to produce advanced or intelligent life. If both Earth and Mars share a genetic heritage, it is possible that a human-like species could have evolved on Mars.\\nAlthough many believe that the Face on Mars must have something to do with humanity, there is the equally unsettling possibility that the Mars Face was constructed by alien beings who just happen to look similar to humans.\\n\\n**Mars in the Crossfire**\\n\\nIn the three years that have passed since the Mars Global Surveyor probereturned its second glimpse of the Face, the scientific search for alienartifacts on the Martian surface has achieved an urgency offset only by the scoffing remarks offered by NASA and JPL, whose statements have led some to suggest that the experts either do not understand the workings of their own instruments or else feel threatened by the Face’s enduring mystery.\\nSelf-proclaimed skeptics have continued their denouncements of the features in Cydonia. Yet debunkers who compared the Mars Face to          natural profiles on Earth (such as New Hampshire’s former “Old Man of the Mountain”) ignore that the formations on Earth are only          visible under limited viewing conditions. And NASA has continued to betray its pledge to reimage the Cydonia region.\\nAt the same time, our understanding of Mars is changing. We now know that the rusted sands of our sister planet may harbor liquid          water, a prerequisite for carbon-based organic chemistry. Not ony that, but notable scientists such as Arthur C. Clarke have stated that images          from the Mars Global Surveyor show probable macroscopic lifeforms.\\nNASA refuses to comment, presumably because the discovery of life on Mars would encourage a manned mission to Mars, thus dealing          a fatal blow to JPL’s Mars Exploration Program, which hinges solely on telerobotic orbiters and landers. But rather than drown in speculation,          many scientists and curious laymen simply want to resolve the lingering question: is the Face artificial or a freakish natural formation?\\nAs Stanley McDaniel has argued both online and in The McDaniel Report (his book on NASA’s scientific failure to investigate Cydonia), the Face on Mars offers a challenge to the prevailing Search for Extraterrestrial          Intelligence (SETI) paradigm; perhaps “aliens” are not so alien after all!\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]],\"ghostVersion\":\"3.0\"}",

                        "plaintext": "In 1976, a space probe orbiting Mars took a photograph of a formation on the\nsurface of the planet which resembled a humanoid face. Is the formation the\nsignature of an unknown intelligence or simply the work of erosion? At first\nglance, the implications of intelligent life on Mars—let alone an intelligence\ncapable of carving a human likeness in the desert—seems absurd.\nBut regardless of first impressions, the Face on Mars remains a genuine\nscientific enigma. Its dimensions and geometry are suspiciously\nartificial-looking, as would be expected from an intentionally created monument.\nAnd rigorous computer modeling has put to rest the conventional wisdom that the\nFace is a fortuitous trick of light and shadow; the Face remains face-like when\nviewed from a variety of angles and illumination conditions.\nOver the years, our collective dismissal of the Face has affected the very\nfabric of scientific methodology. For instance, when a confirming photograph of\nthe Face arrived from Mars in April of 1998, technicians at Pasadena, CA’s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory (JPL) obliterated it with an arsenal of arbitrary graphics\nfilters before releasing it to the media.\nWith the mainstream press placated by what looked more like a two-dimensional\nfootprint than a humanoid face, NASA hoped that the mystery would vanish.\nInstead, the Face—and other unusual features in the Cydonia Mensae region of\nMars—became underground superstars. Hundreds of sites cropped up on the Web,\nmany of them claiming that the Martian face must have been artificially created.\n\nThe Face in Context\n\nThe Face rests upon a rectangular platform and seems to have a linear adornment\nalong its so-called “headdress,” which brings to mind the megalithic artwork\nfound on Earth. But what is most intriguing is that the Mars Face is humanoid in\nstructure, with an anatomically correct eye visible beneath a heavy brow, at\nleast one nostril, and a gaping mouth.\nNearby lurks the City Pyramid, an enormous five-sided feature with suggestions\nof erosion around its edges, and an enigmatic feature dubbed the “Fort.” Both of\nthese anomalies share the Face’s vertical axis and both are roughly the same\nsize, implying architecture. Futhermore, the Cydonia region on Mars contains\nseveral intriguing small-scale Mounds that suggest deliberate mathematical\narrangement, emphasizing the tetrahedral constant of 19.5 degrees.\nNot only that, but the architectural resemblance is striking between Mounds P\nand E. Mound P is a bisymmetric, bunker-like feature accompanied by an elevated\nhexagon, whereas Mound E appears to be a weathered five-sided pyramid, not\nunlike the much larger City Pyramid, which is perched atop a shallow buried\nsquare. In the adjacent corner of the square, a smooth-edged tetrahedron pokes\nup from the accumulated dirt, also begging explanation.\nTogether with the vast D&M Pyramid to the south—and other unnatural-looking\nformations in the region—the Face appears to be part of a complex of artificial\nstructures. Even if the Face were not present, the Fort and Mounds would\ncertainly warrant further investigation.\n\nWhose Face Is It, Anyway?\n\nIf the Face on Mars is artificial, how do we reconcile its humanoid likeness\nwith its location on a supposedly dead planet?\nThe theory of panspermia—in which hibernating microscopic life is shuttled\nthrough space aboard comets and planetary debris—has become an increasingly\naccepted theory on the origins of life among exobiologists, who note that both\nEarth and Mars exchange tons of matter annually in the form of meteors.\nIn fact, some scientists have argued that life on Earth originated not on Earth\nitself but inside comets that crashed together during the formation of the solar\nsystem, potentially seeding both Earth and Mars with ready-made micro-organisms\nderived from the same genetic alphabet. If so, the hypothesized “Martians” who\nconstructed the Face may be our relatives. For if lifeforms are indeed capable\nof hitching rides between planets, then life on Earth could have Martian\nancestry, or Martian life could have terrestrial ancestry. Or Mars and Earth\ncould host life that was originally foreign to both planets.\nTheoretically, panspermia could even accelerate evolution on a recipient planet\nby importing new DNA sequences, or even simple organisms. The idea of\nbio-friendly planets being genetically jump-started threatens the prevailing\nwisdom that Mars was not “alive long enough” to produce advanced or intelligent\nlife. If both Earth and Mars share a genetic heritage, it is possible that a\nhuman-like species could have evolved on Mars.\nAlthough many believe that the Face on Mars must have something to do with\nhumanity, there is the equally unsettling possibility that the Mars Face was\nconstructed by alien beings who just happen to look similar to humans.\n\nMars in the Crossfire\n\nIn the three years that have passed since the Mars Global Surveyor probereturned\nits second glimpse of the Face, the scientific search for alienartifacts on the\nMartian surface has achieved an urgency offset only by the scoffing remarks\noffered by NASA and JPL, whose statements have led some to suggest that the\nexperts either do not understand the workings of their own instruments or else\nfeel threatened by the Face’s enduring mystery.\nSelf-proclaimed skeptics have continued their denouncements of the features in\nCydonia. Yet debunkers who compared the Mars Face to natural profiles on Earth\n(such as New Hampshire’s former “Old Man of the Mountain”) ignore that the\nformations on Earth are only visible under limited viewing conditions. And NASA\nhas continued to betray its pledge to reimage the Cydonia region.\nAt the same time, our understanding of Mars is changing. We now know that the\nrusted sands of our sister planet may harbor liquid water, a prerequisite for\ncarbon-based organic chemistry. Not ony that, but notable scientists such as\nArthur C. Clarke have stated that images from the Mars Global Surveyor show\nprobable macroscopic lifeforms.\nNASA refuses to comment, presumably because the discovery of life on Mars would\nencourage a manned mission to Mars, thus dealing a fatal blow to JPL’s Mars\nExploration Program, which hinges solely on telerobotic orbiters and landers.\nBut rather than drown in speculation, many scientists and curious laymen simply\nwant to resolve the lingering question: is the Face artificial or a freakish\nnatural formation?\nAs Stanley McDaniel has argued both online and in The McDaniel Report (his book\non NASA’s scientific failure to investigate Cydonia), the Face on Mars offers a\nchallenge to the prevailing Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI)\nparadigm; perhaps “aliens” are not so alien after all!",

Even as late as the 1600s, scientist Sir Isaac Newton was obsessed with trying to calculate the coming of the End Times, as promised in the Book of Revelations.\\nHowever, as the Age of Reason gained ground, and thinkers sought to improve life in the here-and-now, interest in Armageddon declined.

For instance, the Millerites of rural New York State, as well as the Mormons and the Jehovah’s Witnesses, believed that the end would come in 1844, a notion based on the lifespans in Genesis and a division of history into a 6,000-year “week” (beginning with Creation) followed by a 1,000-year “sabbath.”\\nHowever, as the optimism of the Victorian era was replaced by the post-World War II dread of chemical and biological warfare and the nuclear angst of the Cold War, so, too, has fear of the End regained its popularity—albeit in a different guise. For just as technology has replaced religion as our means of explaining the world to ourselves, so, too, have the various end-time scenarios assumed a modern façade. Today, it is believed that asteroids and biological disasters will bring about history’s grand finale. Such fears may reflect a deep ambiguity that many feel about the world that we have created for ourselves—and, of course, there is the danger that the Apocalypse will become a self-fulfilling prophecy.\\n\\n**Modern Doomsday Scenarios**\\n\\nThe mechanisms of which modern prophets warn vary wildly. Some scientists warn that an experiment in nanotechnology could result in a horde of tiny, self-replicating robots that transform everything they touch into “gray goo.” Other harbingers of doom feel that genetic tinkering with more mundane viruses and bacteria could create a super-plague that would make the Black Death seem like a bad cold.\\nAnother type of doomsday scenario is the specter of a titanic meteorite hitting the earth. Such a disaster is generally believed to have caused the extinction of the dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous age. And certainly, such life-shattering impacts are not unheard of in modern times.

Though large meteor impacts are rare, the frightening aspect is that science has no means of destroying such a threat if it should arise.\\nThen, of course, there are intentional bringers of doom: terrorists or disgruntled souls who feel that the world might be better off without people. Such a person or organization could unleash a chemical or biological plague that would kill thousands, or even millions, before it was stopped. Even worse would be a nuclear bomb set off on California’s San Andreas Fault, an event which would set off devastating earthquakes in the region. When one considers the multitude of groups and individuals who might want to cause such a disaster, the real question becomes not their possible motivations but who is closest to developing the means.\\n\\n**Keeping the End at Bay**\\n\\nSo how does one prevent the End?

Farmers in the mountains of Victoria refer to the creature as the “Big Cats,” although some insist that what they are seeing are actually North American mountain lions. Many, however, say that while the creature looks superficially like a puma or a panther, on close inspection, it most definitely is no cat.\\nThe Queensland Tiger is usually described as a heavy-set animal about the size of a large dog, with stripes across its back. It has a feline head and is said to be able to disembowel dogs with one swipe of its claws. Its peculiar hopping gate, great leaps, and pouches in females, indicate that it is a marsupial.\\nHowever, nearly all the tigers seen in Victoria are black or dark chocolate brown. A few reports from New South Wales, the state immediately north of Victoria, describe the creature as having black stripes on its rump and tail, which are hard to see from afar on its dark brown fur.\\nThe creature is said to have a large, round head with small, pointed, or triangular ears. The head is often described as disproportionately large in relation to the body and is supported by a thick neck. Their eyes are large and positioned towards the front of the head, giving the creature binocular vision.\\nThese beasts are superb climbers, literally able to run up the trunks of gum trees and sheer rock faces with ease. They generally keep to thick eucalyptus forests but are sometimes, especially in winter, seen in bracken scrub, which is plentiful in the lowland forest that abuts their main habitat.\\nThey can supposedly spring up to 30 feet from a standing start. In flight, their motion is one of leaping or bounding, with all four legs involved in the action and the tail beating up and down in rhythm. Since they move with an awkward, shuffling gait at slow speed, some believe that this is because, as marsupials, they are unable to move their hind legs independently.\\nThese Australian “lions” may primarily be tree-lovers, but reports of them come in even from the remotest corners of the Australian desert.

The newest\nFujitsu products feature impressive storage capacities of 250GB and 300GB, the\nfirst 2.5\" PMR hard disk drives in the industry to attain these high levels of\ncapacity. The MHX2300BT series will begin shipping in the first quarter of 2007.\nJust last March, Fujitsu successfully launched the world's first 2.5\" Serial ATA\n(SATA) hard disk drive to feature up to 200GB of storage space. Today, less than\na year later, Fujitsu sets the standard even higher as it introduces its latest\nultra-high capacity mobile hard disk drive series. Engineered using\nperpendicular magnetic recording technology, which is essential to achieving the\nincreased capacity per platter, the new small form factor HDDs will address the\ngrowing demand for higher capacity storage solutions.

Speaking to PC World, Ben Fathi, the executive in charge of the OS's\ncore components, made it clear that he was referring to a whole new OS -- known\nto have the codename \"Vienna\" -- and not the upcoming Vista service pack,\ncodenamed \"Fiji.\" Other than this tentative release date, Ben didn't have much\nnew information on the future for Windows: in response to the question of what\nVienna's killer feature will be, he said \"I don't know what it is\" and then\nproceeded to suggest that full virtualization and a radical new user interface\nwill be the aim. Both of these suggestions lend credence to previous reports\nthat a break in compatiblity with older applications and a new user interface\nwould be Vienna's flagship features. Now all we've got to do is wait (and hope\nthat the changes aren't too radical.)",

Such a\nfeat was held to be impossible by theorists, backed up by experimentation,\nbecause it is in effect a two-dimensional crystal that is supposed to be\ndestroyed instantly by heat. It is so stable that it holds together in vacuums\nand at room temperature; it is thought to be able to exist because it undulates\nslightly. All other known materials oxidize, decompose and become unstable at\nsizes ten times the thickness. It was created by scientists at the University of\nManchester, working with the Max Planck Institute in Germany. \"This is a\ncompletely new type of technology — even nanotechnology is not the right word to\ndescribe these new membranes. We have made proof-of-concept devices and believe\nthat the technology transfer to other areas should be straightforward. The real\nchallenge is to make such membranes cheap and readily available for large-scale\napplications,\" said Professor Andre Geim, of the University of Manchester.\n\nPossible applications for the new advancement are expected in researching new\ndrugs and to separate gases into their constituent parts. In medical research\nthe membrane, which at single-atom thickness measures 0.35 nanometers, could be\nused as the support for molecules being analyzed by electron microscopes. The\nthinness of graphene membranes is such that the electrons would have much less\nirrelevant material to pass through and so be able to give a clearer picture of\nthe structure of molecules, especially the proteins believed to hold the key to\na generation of medicines. It can also be used to vastly increase computer\nspeeds; it can potentially one day replace silicon because it can be used as a\nfaster transistor that consumes less power. Leonid Ponomarenko, of the\nUniversity of Manchester, is optimistic that it can be turned into a commercial\nsuccess:\n\nThe technology has managed to progress steadily from millimetre-sized\ntransistors to current microprocessors with individual elements down to ten\nnanometres in size. The next logical step is true nanometer-sized circuits",

But as galaxies go, it's\npractically a neighbor. At only 120 trillion miles away, the red dwarf star that\nthis planet circles is one of the 100 closest to Earth.\n\nThe results of the discovery have not been published but have been submitted to\nthe journal Astronomy and Astrophysics.\n\nAlan Boss, who works at the Carnegie Institution of Washington where a U.S. team\nof astronomers competed in the hunt for an Earth-like planet, called it \"a major\nmilestone in this business.\"\n\nThe planet was discovered by the European Southern Observatory's telescope in La\nSilla, Chile, which has a special instrument that splits light to find wobbles\nin different wavelengths. Those wobbles can reveal the existence of other\nworlds.\n\nWhat they revealed is a planet circling the red dwarf star, Gliese 581. Red\ndwarfs are low-energy, tiny stars that give off dim red light and last longer\nthan stars like our sun. Until a few years ago, astronomers didn't consider\nthese stars as possible hosts of planets that might sustain life.\n\nThe discovery of the new planet, named 581 c, is sure to fuel studies of planets\ncircling similar dim stars. About 80 percent of the stars near Earth are red\ndwarfs.\n\nThe new planet is about five times heavier than Earth, and gravity there would\nbe 1.6 times as strong as Earth's. Its discoverers aren't certain if it is rocky\nlike Earth or if its a frozen ice ball with liquid water on the surface. If it\nis rocky like Earth, which is what the prevailing theory proposes, it has a\ndiameter about 11/2 times bigger than our planet. If it is an iceball, as Mayor\nsuggests, it would be even bigger.\n\nBased on theory, 581 c should have an atmosphere, but what's in that atmosphere\nis still a mystery and if it's too thick that could make the planet's surface\ntemperature too hot, Mayor said.\n\nHowever, the research team believes the average temperature to be somewhere\nbetween 32 and 104 degrees and that set off celebrations among astronomers.\n\nUntil now, all 220 planets astronomers have found outside our solar system have\nhad the \"Goldilocks problem.\" They've been too hot, too cold or just plain too\nbig and gaseous, like uninhabitable Jupiter.\n\nThe new planet seems just right -- or at least that's what scientists think.\n\n\"This could be very important,\" said NASA astrobiology expert Chris McKay, who\nwas not part of the discovery team. \"It doesn't mean there is life, but it means\nit's an Earth-like planet in terms of potential habitability.\"\n\nEventually astronomers will rack up discoveries of dozens, maybe even hundreds\nof planets considered habitable, the astronomers said. But this one -- simply\ncalled \"c\" by its discoverers when they talk among themselves -- will go down in\ncosmic history as No. 1.\n\nBesides having the right temperature, the new planet is probably full of liquid\nwater, hypothesizes Stephane Udry, the discovery team's lead author and another\nGeneva astronomer. But that is based on theory about how planets form, not on\nany evidence, he said.\n\nLiquid water is critical to life as we know it,\" co-author Xavier Delfosse of\nGrenoble University in France, said in a statement. \"Because of its temperature\nand relative proximity, this planet will most probably be a very important\ntarget of the future space missions dedicated to the search for extraterrestrial\nlife. On the treasure map of the Universe, one would be tempted to mark this\nplanet with an X.\n\nOther astronomers cautioned it's too early to tell whether there is water.\n\n\"You need more work to say it's got water or it doesn't have water,\" said\nretired NASA astronomer Steve Maran, press officer for the American Astronomical\nSociety. \"You wouldn't send a crew there assuming that when you get there,\nthey'll have enough water to get back.\"\n\nThe new planet's star system is a mere 20.5 light years away, making Gliese 581\none of the 100 closest stars to Earth. It's so dim, you can't see it without a\ntelescope, but it's somewhere in the constellation Libra, which is low in the\nsoutheastern sky during the mid-evening in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nEven so, Maran noted, \"We don't know how to get to those places in a human\nlifetime.\"\n\nBut, oh, the view, if you could. The planet is 14 times closer to the star it\norbits. Udry figures the red dwarf star would hang in the sky at a size 20 times\nlarger than our moon. And it's likely, but still not known, that the planet\ndoesn't rotate, so one side would always be sunlit and the other dark.\n\nTwo teams of astronomers, one in Europe and one in the United States, have been\nracing to be the first to find a planet like 581 c outside the solar system.\n\nThe European team looked at 100 different stars using a tool called HARPS (High\nAccuracy Radial Velocity for Planetary Searcher) to find this one planet, said\nXavier Bonfils of the Lisbon Observatory, one of the co-discoverers.\n\nMuch of the effort to find Earth-like planets has focused on stars like our sun\nwith the challenge being to find a planet the right distance from the star it\norbits. About 90 percent of the time, the European telescope focused its search\nmore on sun-like stars, Udry said.\n\nA few weeks before the European discovery earlier this month, a scientific paper\nin the journal Astrobiology theorized a few days that red dwarf stars were good\ncandidates.\n\n\"Now we have the possibility to find many more,\" Bonfils said.",

If so, it would help resolve a quantum conundrum known as the black hole information paradox, but critics say it would also raise new problems, such as how the wormholes would form in the first place.\\n\\nA black hole is an object with such a powerful gravitational field that nothing, not even light, can escape it if it strays within a boundary known as the event horizon. Einstein's theory of general relativity says black holes should form whenever matter is squeezed into a small enough space.\\n\\nThough black holes are not seen directly, astronomers have identified many objects that appear to be black holes based on observations of how matter swirls around them.\\n\\nBut physicists Thibault Damour of the Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques in Bures-sur-Yvette, France, and Sergey Solodukhin of International University Bremen in Germany now say that these objects could be structures called wormholes instead.\\n\\nWormholes are warps in the fabric of space-time that connect one place to another. If you imagine the universe as a two-dimensional sheet, you can picture a wormhole as a \\\"throat\\\" connecting our sheet to another one. In this scenario, the other sheet could be a universe of its own, with its own stars, galaxies and planets.\\n\\nDamour and Solodukhin studied what such a wormhole might look like, and were surprised to discover that it would mimic a black hole so well that it would be virtually impossible to tell the difference.\\n\\n<strong>Hawking radiation\\n</strong>\\n\\nMatter would swirl around a wormhole in the same way as for a black hole, since both objects distort the space around them in the same way.\\n\\nOne might hope to distinguish the two by something called Hawking radiation, an emission of particles and light which should only come from black holes and would have a characteristic energy spectrum. But this radiation is so weak that it would be completely swamped by other sources, such as the background glow of microwaves left over from the big bang, making it unobservable in practice.\\n\\nAnother difference one might hope to exploit is that unlike black holes, wormholes have no event horizon. This means that things could go in a wormhole and come back out again. In fact, theorists say one variety of wormhole wraps back onto itself, so that it leads not to another universe, but back to its own entrance.\\n\\n<strong>Daring plunge\\n</strong>\\n\\nBut this does not provide a foolproof test either. Depending on the detailed shape of the wormhole, it could take billions of years or more for things to pop back out after falling in. With the right shape, even the oldest wormholes in our universe would not have had time to spit anything back out yet.\\n\\nIt seems the only way to decide the issue for sure with astronomical black holes is to make a daring plunge inside. That would be a dangerous gamble, because if it is a black hole, the incredibly strong gravitational field inside would tear apart every atom in your body. Even if it turns out to be a wormhole, the forces inside could still be deadly.\\n\\nAssuming you could survive, and the wormhole was not symmetric, you might find yourself in another universe on the other side. Without further intervention, the wormhole would tend to suck you back in and carry you back to the opening in your universe.\\n\\n<strong>Yo-yo motion\\n</strong>\\n\\n\\\"The spaceship would do this yo-yo motion,\\\" Damour told <strong>New Scientist</strong>. \\\"[But] if you use your fuel, then you can escape from the attracting power of the wormhole and explore\\\" the space on the other side, he says.\\n\\nBut a friend in either universe might have to wait billions of years to hear back from you, since the transit time could be excruciatingly long.\\n\\nSuch a delay would make meaningful communication with anyone on the other side impossible. But the delay gets smaller with smaller wormholes. If a microscopic wormhole could be found or constructed, the delay across it could be as short as a few seconds, Solodukhin says, potentially making two-way communication possible.\\n\\nStephen Hsu of the University of Oregon in Eugene, US, who has studied the formation of black holes and the properties of wormholes, says he agrees that distinguishing between the two types of object with observations is practically impossible, at least with current technology.\\n\\n<strong>Exotic matter\\n</strong>\\n\\n\\\"The most important property of a black hole – that there is a 'point of no return' for an object falling in – is not something we can test at the moment,\\\" he told <strong>New Scientist</strong>.\\n\\nStill, he says the objects out there suspected to be black holes probably really are black holes rather than wormholes. There are plausible scenarios for forming black holes, he says, such as the collapse of a massive star, but it is not clear how you would form a wormhole.\\n\\n>\\\"Wormholes that might be confused with a macroscopic black hole require some kind of exotic matter to stabilise them, and it is not known whether such exotic matter exists,\\\" he says.\\n\\nSolodukhin says that a wormhole might form in much the same way that black holes form, such as from a collapsing star.

One possibility is that the soil\nmixed with acid vapors in the presence of water. Others believe the deposit was\ncreated from water in a hot spring surrounding.\n\nThe durable Spirit and its twin, Opportunity, have been working on overtime\nsince completing their primary, three-month mission in 2004.\n\nFor eight months, Opportunity has explored the rim of Victoria Crater on the\nopposite side of the planet.

However, when there's a company claiming that it can beat Intel's last year's product by a factor of 10x and 30x, depending on discipline, it's certainly worth a look.\\n\\nThe Tile64 is a 90 nm RISC-based processor clocked between 600 MHz and 1 GHz  aiming for integration in embedded applications such as routers, switches, appliances, video conferencing systems and set-top boxes. Its manufacturer claims that the CPU solves a critical problem in multi-core scaling and opens the door to hundreds or even thousands of cores using this new architecture.\\n\\nOther than for example Intel's Core architecture, which is expected to soon be running into a bottleneck caused by its centralized bus architecture (which acts as communication node between all cores), Tilera's cores can exchange data with all other cores through a \\\"mesh\\\" architecture. Each of the 64 tiles consists of a CPU unit, a cache unit and a switch, which can send information into four directions to neighboring \\\"tiles\\\". Each tile has a bandwidth of 500 Gb/s, with the Tile64's aggregate bandwidth topping out at 32 Tb/s.\\n\\nBesides the fact that Tilera claims that it has untangled a data traffic mess that otherwise would have surrounded a central bus, the company has come up with an interesting and flexible cache architecture for the tiles, each of which is able to act as a fully functioning system that can run an operating system. Each tile integrates two 8 KB L1 caches (8 KB iL1, 8 KB dL1) as well as a 64 KB L2 cache. There is no L3 cache per se, but if required by the application, a software developer can utilize all L1 and L2 caches as one 5 MB L3 cache.\\n<p class=\\\"mosimage\\\" align=\\\"center\\\"><img src=\\\"http://www.tgdaily.com/images/stories/article_images/processor/tilera2_425.jpg\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" alt=\\\"Image\\\" hspace=\\\"6\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"275\\\" /></p>\\n<p class=\\\"mosimage_caption\\\" style=\\\"text-align:left;\\\" align=\\\"left\\\">Tile64 layout with 8x8 tiles and ...</p>\\n<p class=\\\"mosimage\\\" align=\\\"center\\\"><img src=\\\"http://www.tgdaily.com/images/stories/article_images/processor/tilera3_425.jpg\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" alt=\\\"Image\\\" hspace=\\\"6\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"282\\\" /></p>\\n<p class=\\\"mosimage_caption\\\" style=\\\"text-align:left;\\\" align=\\\"left\\\">... the layout of one tile in detail.</p>\\n\\nThe result is a claimed performance that is ten times what a dual-core Xeon offers, while performance per watt is exceeding the Xeon by 30x. The manufacturer states that each tile consumes a maximum of 300 mWatt, which translates into a maximum power consumption of 19.2 watts per Tile64 chip. Still, there is enough horsepower to encode eight parallel standard definition video streams at  2 Mb/s per stream, two high definition 720p streams at 7 Mb/s each or one 1080p video stream at 20 Mb/s.\\n\\nAccording to Tilera, programmers can get their application up and running on Tile64 \\\"very quickly\\\", while they mentioned that \\\"fine-tuning\\\" will optimize the software's performance.\\n\\nTilera said that the processor is available now. For a new entry into the market, Tilera priced its product with confidence: 10K-tray pricing is set at $435 for each Tile64 – which appears cheap, if it can replace ten Xeon processors. But in a real world environment, the processor is priced against a quad-core Xeon 5345 (2.33 GHz, 8 MB L2 cache), which currently sells for a 1K tray price of $455.\\n\\nInitial customers using the processor in upcoming products include 3Com, Top Layer, Codian and GoBackTV.\\n\\nOf course, every time a new processor company comes around, there is the question if there is really enough room for another player – in this case, a market where heavyweights such as Intel and Texas Instruments battle for market shares. Other than PA Semi, a relatively new microprocessor company that does not build its processor, but licenses its technology, Tilera is actually manufacturing the Tile64, which is reminiscent of the rise and fall of Transmeta.\\n\\nIf you have been around in this industry for some time, then you may remember that Transmeta was in \\\"stealth mode\\\" from 1997-2000 and reason for media reports mainly because of one famous employee, Linux inventor Linus Torvalds.

Each\ntile integrates two 8 KB L1 caches (8 KB iL1, 8 KB dL1) as well as a 64 KB L2\ncache. There is no L3 cache per se, but if required by the application, a\nsoftware developer can utilize all L1 and L2 caches as one 5 MB L3 cache.\n\n\n\nTile64 layout with 8x8 tiles and ...\n\n\n\n... the layout of one tile in detail.\n\nThe result is a claimed performance that is ten times what a dual-core Xeon\noffers, while performance per watt is exceeding the Xeon by 30x. The\nmanufacturer states that each tile consumes a maximum of 300 mWatt, which\ntranslates into a maximum power consumption of 19.2 watts per Tile64 chip.\nStill, there is enough horsepower to encode eight parallel standard definition\nvideo streams at 2 Mb/s per stream, two high definition 720p streams at 7 Mb/s\neach or one 1080p video stream at 20 Mb/s.\n\nAccording to Tilera, programmers can get their application up and running on\nTile64 \"very quickly\", while they mentioned that \"fine-tuning\" will optimize the\nsoftware's performance.\n\nTilera said that the processor is available now. For a new entry into the\nmarket, Tilera priced its product with confidence: 10K-tray pricing is set at\n$435 for each Tile64 – which appears cheap, if it can replace ten Xeon\nprocessors. But in a real world environment, the processor is priced against a\nquad-core Xeon 5345 (2.33 GHz, 8 MB L2 cache), which currently sells for a 1K\ntray price of $455.\n\nInitial customers using the processor in upcoming products include 3Com, Top\nLayer, Codian and GoBackTV.\n\nOf course, every time a new processor company comes around, there is the\nquestion if there is really enough room for another player – in this case, a\nmarket where heavyweights such as Intel and Texas Instruments battle for market\nshares. Other than PA Semi, a relatively new microprocessor company that does\nnot build its processor, but licenses its technology, Tilera is actually\nmanufacturing the Tile64, which is reminiscent of the rise and fall of\nTransmeta.\n\nIf you have been around in this industry for some time, then you may remember\nthat Transmeta was in \"stealth mode\" from 1997-2000 and reason for media reports\nmainly because of one famous employee, Linux inventor Linus Torvalds. Transmeta\nlaunched with great fanfare in January 2000, but never got a foot on the ground\nand today is struggling to survive with revenues from licensing its LongRun2\ntechnology to companies such as NEC.\n\nCompanies such as Tilera are exposed to the problems that broke Transmeta's neck\nin CPU manufacturing: Microprocessor buyers today, for example, expect a track\nrecord of reliability that new companies cannot offer, buyers expect a support\nsystem, extensive manufacturing capabilities, a long-term roadmap that reveals\nwhat can be expected in terms of performance and feature set. Transmeta never\nmade it much further than a presence in Asian markets, a few sub-notebooks on\nthese shores as well as exotic computing solutions such as desktop clusters.\nTilera, however, believes that it is competing in a different and \"aggressively\nadopting\" multi-core market in which it has the performance edge (which\nTransmeta never had).\n\nDuring our briefing with Tilera, chief technology officer Anant Agarwal told us\nthat he believes that the company has solved a \"huge problem\" of multi-core\narchitectures and therefore has a substantial advantage: \"We know how to get to\nhundreds of cores. This means that we are way ahead of the competition.\"",

For Oracle 10g Database, the OFA recommended Oracle home path has changed.\\r\\nThe home path for the first 10g (10.1.0) database installation on a system would be:\\r\\n<pre lang=\\\"bash\\\">  /u01/app/oracle/product/10.1.0/<strong>db_1</strong></pre>\\r\\nIf you would install a second Oracle 10g Database 10g (10.1.0) on the same system, the Oracle home directory would be as follows:\\r\\n<pre lang=\\\"bash\\\">  /u01/app/oracle/product/10.1.0/db_<strong>2</strong></pre>\\r\\nIf the Oracle10g software is not owned by the user <tt>oracle</tt> but by the user \\\"oraowner\\\", then the path of the Oracle home directory would be:\\r\\n<pre lang=\\\"bash\\\">  /u01/app/<strong>oraowner</strong>/product/10.1.0/db_1\\r\\n  /u01/app/<strong>oraowner</strong>/product/10.1.0/db_2</pre>\\r\\nThe standard directory name for Oracle10g is \\\"app\\\":\\r\\n<pre lang=\\\"bash\\\">  /u01/<strong>app</strong>/oracle/product/10.1.0/db_1</pre>\\r\\nOracle recommends to use mount points such as <tt>/u01</tt>, <tt>/u02</tt>, etc. which complies with the OFA guidelines. But others can be used, for example:\\r\\n<pre lang=\\\"bash\\\">  /<strong>disk_1</strong>/app/oracle/product/10.1.0/db_1</pre>\\r\\nThe subtree for database files not stored in ASM disk groups should be named as follows:\\r\\n<pre lang=\\\"bash\\\">  <strong>/u02</strong>/oradata/&lt;<em>db_name_1</em>&gt;\\r\\n  <strong>/u02</strong>/oradata/&lt;<em>db_name_2</em>&gt;\\r\\n  <strong>/u03</strong>/oradata/&lt;<em>db_name_1</em>&gt;\\r\\n  <strong>/u03</strong>/oradata/&lt;<em>db_name_2</em>&gt;</pre>\\r\\nThe mount point <tt>/u01</tt> should be used for the Oracle software only. <tt>/u02</tt>, <tt>/u03</tt>, <tt>/u04</tt> etc. should be used for the database files. The <tt>db_name</tt> stands for the <tt>DB_NAME</tt> initialization parameter which is typically the same as the SID name for single instance databases.\\r\\n<h4><span style=\\\"text-decoration: underline;\\\">Setting Oracle Environments</span></h4>\\r\\nSince the Oracle Universal Installer (OUI) \\\"<tt>runInstaller</tt>\\\" is run from the <tt>oracle</tt> account, some environment variables must be configured for this account before OUI is started.\\r\\nExecute the following commands for the Bash shell which is the default shell on Red Hat Linux (to verify your shell run: <tt>echo $SHELL</tt>):\\r\\n<pre lang=\\\"bash\\\">su - oracle\\r\\nexport ORACLE_BASE=/u01/app/oracle\\r\\nexport ORACLE_SID=orcl</pre>\\r\\n<strong>NOTE</strong>: If <tt>ORACLE_BASE</tt> is used, then Oracle recommends that you don't set the <tt>ORACLE_HOME</tt> environment variable but that you choose the default path suggested by the OUI. You can set and use <tt>ORACLE_HOME</tt> after you finished running OUI.\\r\\nAlso, the environment variables <tt>ORACLE_HOME</tt> and <tt>TNS_ADMIN</tt> should not be set. If you've already set these environment variables, you can unset them by running the following commands:\\r\\n<pre lang=\\\"bash\\\">unset ORACLE_HOME\\r\\nunset TNS_ADMIN</pre>\\r\\nTo have these environment variables set automatically each time you login as <tt>oracle</tt>, you can add these environment variables to the <tt>~oracle/.bash_profile</tt> file which is the user startup file for the Bash shell on Red Hat Linux. To do this you could simply copy/paste the following commands to make these settings permanent for your <tt>oracle</tt>'s Bash shell:\\r\\n<pre lang=\\\"bash\\\">su - oracle\\r\\ncat &gt;&gt; ~oracle/.bash_profile &lt;&lt; EOF\\r\\nexport ORACLE_BASE=/u01/app/oracle\\r\\nexport ORACLE_SID=orcl\\r\\nEOF</pre>\\r\\n<h4><span style=\\\"text-decoration: underline;\\\">Installing Oracle10g</span></h4>\\r\\n<strong>Installing Oracle10g on a Remote Linux Server</strong>\\r\\nIf you don't install Oracle on your local system but on a remote server, then you need to relink X to your local desktop. The easiest way to do this is to use the \\\"X11 forwarding\\\" feature of ssh. This means that you don't have to run <tt>xhost</tt> and set the <tt>DISPLAY</tt> environment variable.\\r\\nHere is an example how to make use of the \\\"X11 forward\\\" feature of ssh. Simply run the following command from your <span style=\\\"text-decoration: underline;\\\">local desktop</span>:\\r\\n<pre lang=\\\"bash\\\">$ ssh -X oracle@oracle_remote_server_name</pre>\\r\\nNow when you try to run any GUI tool on the remote server, it will automatically be relinked to your local desktop. If this is not working, verify that the <tt>ForwardX11</tt> setting is not set to \\\"<tt>no</tt>\\\" in <tt>/etc/ssh/ssh_config</tt> on the remote server:\\r\\n<pre lang=\\\"bash\\\">su - root\\r\\n# grep ForwardX11 /etc/ssh/ssh_config | grep -v \\\"^#\\\"\\r\\n        ForwardX11 yes\\r\\n#</pre>\\r\\nIf you are using <tt>telnet</tt>, however, you will have to set <tt>DISPLAY</tt> manually, see article <a href=\\\"http://www.puschitz.com/InstallingOracle9i.shtml#StartingrunInstaller\\\">Starting runInstaller</a> for more information.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Starting Oracle Universal Installer</strong>\\r\\nInsert the Oracle CD that contains the image of the downloaded file <tt>ship.db.lnx32.cpio</tt>, or change to the directory that contains the image directory <tt>Disk1</tt>.\\r\\nIf you install Oracle10g from a CD, mount the CD by running the following commands in another terminal:\\r\\n<pre lang=\\\"bash\\\">su - root\\r\\nmount /media/cdrom</pre>\\r\\nBefore you execute <tt>runInstaller</tt>, make sure the Oracle environment variables are set, see <a href=\\\"http://www.puschitz.com/InstallingOracle10g.shtml#SettingOracleEnvironments\\\">Setting Oracle Environments</a>. You can verify the settings by running the <tt>set</tt> command:\\r\\n<pre lang=\\\"bash\\\">su - oracle\\r\\noracle$ set</pre>\\r\\nTo execute <tt>runInstaller</tt> from the mounted CD, run the following command as the <tt>oracle</tt> user:\\r\\n<pre lang=\\\"bash\\\">oracle$ /media/cdrom/runInstaller</pre>\\r\\n<strong>Using Oracle Universal Installer (OUI)</strong>\\r\\nThe following example shows how to install x86 Oracle 10g Release 1 Database Software and a \\\"General Purpose\\\" database:\\r\\n(<em>Note, the screens and questions will look different if you install 10g R2 or 64-bit 10g R1 database</em>)\\r\\n<pre lang=\\\"bash\\\">- Welcome Screen:</pre>\\r\\n<pre lang=\\\"bash\\\">        - Basic Installation:       Checked it which is the default\\r\\n        - Oracle Home Location:     Use default: /u01/app/oracle/product/10.1.0/db_1\\r\\n        - Installation Type:        I used the default: Enterprise Edition\\r\\n        - UNIX DBA Group:           Use default: <strong>dba</strong>\\r\\n        - Create Starter Databases: I checked it for this example which is the default\\r\\n        - Global Database Name:     orcl\\r\\n        - Database password:        password for SYS, SYSTEM, SYSMAN, and DBSNMP</pre>\\r\\n<pre lang=\\\"bash\\\">        - Advanced Installation:    For this article I did not check it\\r\\nClick Next\\r\\n\\r\\n- Specify Inventory directory and credentials:\\r\\n        - Full path of the inventory directory: Use default: /u01/app/oracle/oraInventory\\r\\n        - Specify Operating System group name:  Use default: oinstall\\r\\nClick Next\\r\\n\\r\\n- A window pops up to run the orainstRoot.sh script:\\r\\n        Run the script in another terminal:\\r\\n            su - root\\r\\n            # /u01/app/oracle/oraInventory/orainstRoot.sh\\r\\n            Creating the Oracle inventory pointer file (/etc/oraInst.loc)\\r\\n            Changing groupname of /u01/app/oracle/oraInventory to oinstall.\\r\\n            #\\r\\n        Click Continue\\r\\n\\r\\n- Product-specific Prerequisite Checks:\\r\\n        Verify that all checks have been passed.\\r\\n        <strong>Make sure that the status of each Check is set to \\\"Succeeded\\\".\\r\\n        On RHEL AS 4 ignore the warnings for binutils, gcc, and openmotif and proceed.</strong>\\r\\n        Note that the \\\"Retry\\\" button doesn't work after you fixed one of the failed checks.\\r\\nClick Next\\r\\n\\r\\n- Select Database Configuration:\\r\\n        I selected \\\"General Purpose\\\".\\r\\nClick Next\\r\\n\\r\\n- Specify Database Configuration Options:\\r\\n       - Global Database Name: I used \\\"orcl\\\".\\r\\n       - SID: I used \\\"orcl\\\".\\r\\nClick Next\\r\\n\\r\\n- Select Database Management Option:\\r\\n       I selected \\\"Use Database Control for Database Management\\\".\\r\\nClick Next\\r\\n\\r\\n- Specify Database File Storage Option: I selected \\\"File System\\\".\\r\\n       - File System     - Specify Database file location: /u01/app/oracle/oradata/\\r\\n                           If you want to comply with OFA, you should another  mount point\\r\\n                           than '/u01', e.g. /u02/oradata.\\r\\nClick Next\\r\\n\\r\\n- Specify Backup and Recovery Options:\\r\\n         For my test installation I selected \\\"Do no enable Automated Backups\\\".\\r\\nClick Next\\r\\n\\r\\n- Specify Database Schema Passwords:\\r\\n<em>        Make sure that the password(s) don't start with a digit number!

You might also want to check out <a href=\"http://www.puschitz.com/TuningLinuxForOracle.shtml#SizingSwapSpace\">Sizing Swap Space</a>.\nFor test sake I tried to install an Oracle Database 10g (Type: General Purpose Database) on a little PC with 256MB of RAM and 1 GB of swap space.

Here is the procedure:\n<pre lang=\"bash\">su - root\ndd if=/dev/zero of=tmpswap bs=1k count=900000\nchmod 600 tmpswap\nmkswap tmpswap\nswapon tmpswap</pre>\nTo disable the temporary swap space execute the following commands:\n<pre lang=\"bash\">su - root\nswapoff tmpswap\nrm tmpswap</pre>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Checking /tmp Space</span></h4>\nAccording to Oracle's documentation, the Oracle Universal Installer (OUI) requires up to 400 MB of free space in the <tt>/tmp</tt> directory.

For more information on <tt>ulimit</tt> for the Bash shell, see <tt>man bash</tt> and search for <tt>ulimit</tt>.\nIf you just install a small test database, then you might be ok with the current settings (note that the limits very often vary). But for (larger) production databases, you should increase the following shell limits to the following values recommended by Oracle:\n<pre lang=\"bash\">nofile = 65536     (To verify, execute: ulimit -n)\nnproc  = 16384     (To verify, execute: ulimit -u)</pre>\nThe <tt>nofile</tt> option denotes the maximum number of open file descriptors, and <tt>nproc</tt> denotes the maximum number of processes available to a single user.\nTo see all shell limits, execute:\n<pre lang=\"bash\">ulimit -a</pre>\nThe following procedures/links show how to increase these parameters for the <tt>oracle</tt> user account:\nFor more information on <tt>nofile</tt> and how to increase the limit, see <a href=\"http://www.puschitz.com/TuningLinuxForOracle.shtml#SettingLimitsForTheMaximumNumberOfOpenFileDescriptorsForTheOracleUser\">Setting Limits for the Maximum Number of Open File Descriptors for the Oracle User</a>. Even though this procedure was written for Oracle9i on RHAS 2.1, it also applies to Oracle10g on RHEL AS 2.1, RHEL AS 3, and other versions.\nFor more information on <tt>nproc</tt> and how to increase the limit, see <a href=\"http://www.puschitz.com/TuningLinuxForOracle.shtml#SettingLimitsForTheMaximumNumberOfProcessesForTheOracleUser\">Setting Limits for the Maximum Number of Processes for the Oracle User</a>. Even though this procedure was written for Oracle9i on RHAS 2.1, it also applies to Oracle10g on RHEL AS 2.1, RHEL AS 3, and other versions.\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Creating Oracle Directories</span></h4>\nFor Oracle10g you only need to create the directory for <tt>$ORACLE_BASE</tt>:\n<pre lang=\"bash\">su - root\nmkdir -p /u01/app/oracle\nchown oracle.oinstall /u01/app/oracle</pre>\nBut if you want to comply with Oracle's Optimal Flexible Architecture (OFA), then you don't want to place the database files in the <tt>/u01</tt> directory but in another directory/filesystem/disk like <tt>/u02</tt>. This is not a requirement but if you want to comply with OFA, then you might want to create the following directories as well:\n<pre lang=\"bash\">su - root\nmkdir -p /u02/oradata/<em>orcl</em>\nchown oracle.oinstall /u02/oradata/orcl</pre>\nIn this example, \"orcl\" stands for the name of the database which will also be the name of the instance. This is typically the case for single instance databases.\n<strong>Optimal Flexible Architecture (OFA) for 10g R1 (10.1.0.2)</strong>\nThe OFA standard is a guideline created by Oracle to ensure reliable Oracle installations. For Oracle 10g Database, the OFA recommended Oracle home path has changed.\nThe home path for the first 10g (10.1.0) database installation on a system would be:\n<pre lang=\"bash\">  /u01/app/oracle/product/10.1.0/<strong>db_1</strong></pre>\nIf you would install a second Oracle 10g Database 10g (10.1.0) on the same system, the Oracle home directory would be as follows:\n<pre lang=\"bash\">  /u01/app/oracle/product/10.1.0/db_<strong>2</strong></pre>\nIf the Oracle10g software is not owned by the user <tt>oracle</tt> but by the user \"oraowner\", then the path of the Oracle home directory would be:\n<pre lang=\"bash\">  /u01/app/<strong>oraowner</strong>/product/10.1.0/db_1\n  /u01/app/<strong>oraowner</strong>/product/10.1.0/db_2</pre>\nThe standard directory name for Oracle10g is \"app\":\n<pre lang=\"bash\">  /u01/<strong>app</strong>/oracle/product/10.1.0/db_1</pre>\nOracle recommends to use mount points such as <tt>/u01</tt>, <tt>/u02</tt>, etc. which complies with the OFA guidelines. But others can be used, for example:\n<pre lang=\"bash\">  /<strong>disk_1</strong>/app/oracle/product/10.1.0/db_1</pre>\nThe subtree for database files not stored in ASM disk groups should be named as follows:\n<pre lang=\"bash\">  <strong>/u02</strong>/oradata/&lt;<em>db_name_1</em>&gt;\n  <strong>/u02</strong>/oradata/&lt;<em>db_name_2</em>&gt;\n  <strong>/u03</strong>/oradata/&lt;<em>db_name_1</em>&gt;\n  <strong>/u03</strong>/oradata/&lt;<em>db_name_2</em>&gt;</pre>\nThe mount point <tt>/u01</tt> should be used for the Oracle software only. <tt>/u02</tt>, <tt>/u03</tt>, <tt>/u04</tt> etc. should be used for the database files. The <tt>db_name</tt> stands for the <tt>DB_NAME</tt> initialization parameter which is typically the same as the SID name for single instance databases.\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Setting Oracle Environments</span></h4>\nSince the Oracle Universal Installer (OUI) \"<tt>runInstaller</tt>\" is run from the <tt>oracle</tt> account, some environment variables must be configured for this account before OUI is started.\nExecute the following commands for the Bash shell which is the default shell on Red Hat Linux (to verify your shell run: <tt>echo $SHELL</tt>):\n<pre lang=\"bash\">su - oracle\nexport ORACLE_BASE=/u01/app/oracle\nexport ORACLE_SID=orcl</pre>\n<strong>NOTE</strong>: If <tt>ORACLE_BASE</tt> is used, then Oracle recommends that you don't set the <tt>ORACLE_HOME</tt> environment variable but that you choose the default path suggested by the OUI. You can set and use <tt>ORACLE_HOME</tt> after you finished running OUI.\nAlso, the environment variables <tt>ORACLE_HOME</tt> and <tt>TNS_ADMIN</tt> should not be set. If you've already set these environment variables, you can unset them by running the following commands:\n<pre lang=\"bash\">unset ORACLE_HOME\nunset TNS_ADMIN</pre>\nTo have these environment variables set automatically each time you login as <tt>oracle</tt>, you can add these environment variables to the <tt>~oracle/.bash_profile</tt> file which is the user startup file for the Bash shell on Red Hat Linux. To do this you could simply copy/paste the following commands to make these settings permanent for your <tt>oracle</tt>'s Bash shell:\n<pre lang=\"bash\">su - oracle\ncat &gt;&gt; ~oracle/.bash_profile &lt;&lt; EOF\nexport ORACLE_BASE=/u01/app/oracle\nexport ORACLE_SID=orcl\nEOF</pre>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Installing Oracle10g</span></h4>\n<strong>Installing Oracle10g on a Remote Linux Server</strong>\nIf you don't install Oracle on your local system but on a remote server, then you need to relink X to your local desktop. The easiest way to do this is to use the \"X11 forwarding\" feature of ssh. This means that you don't have to run <tt>xhost</tt> and set the <tt>DISPLAY</tt> environment variable.\nHere is an example how to make use of the \"X11 forward\" feature of ssh. Simply run the following command from your <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">local desktop</span>:\n<pre lang=\"bash\">$ ssh -X oracle@oracle_remote_server_name</pre>\nNow when you try to run any GUI tool on the remote server, it will automatically be relinked to your local desktop. If this is not working, verify that the <tt>ForwardX11</tt> setting is not set to \"<tt>no</tt>\" in <tt>/etc/ssh/ssh_config</tt> on the remote server:\n<pre lang=\"bash\">su - root\n# grep ForwardX11 /etc/ssh/ssh_config | grep -v \"^#\"\n        ForwardX11 yes\n#</pre>\nIf you are using <tt>telnet</tt>, however, you will have to set <tt>DISPLAY</tt> manually, see article <a href=\"http://www.puschitz.com/InstallingOracle9i.shtml#StartingrunInstaller\">Starting runInstaller</a> for more information.\n<p><strong>Starting Oracle Universal Installer</strong><br>\nInsert the Oracle CD that contains the image of the downloaded file <tt>ship.db.lnx32.cpio</tt>, or change to the directory that contains the image directory <tt>Disk1</tt>.<br>\nIf you install Oracle10g from a CD, mount the CD by running the following commands in another terminal:</p>\n<pre lang=\"bash\">su - root\nmount /media/cdrom</pre>\n<p>Before you execute <tt>runInstaller</tt>, make sure the Oracle environment variables are set, see <a href=\"http://www.puschitz.com/InstallingOracle10g.shtml#SettingOracleEnvironments\">Setting Oracle Environments</a>.

                        "plaintext": "I have been recently installing Oracle on a RHEL system, so thought I would post\nan how to, so it will be easier for me or you do it later.\n\nThe following procedure is a step-by-step guide (Cookbook) with tips and\ninformation for installing Oracle Database 10g on Red Hat Linux.\nThis guide shows how I installed 10g Database on the Red Hat system:\n\nDownloading Oracle10g Software and Burning Oracle10g CDs\nDownload Oracle 10g (32-bit and 64-bit) for Linux from OTN to install linux 10g\noracle:http://otn.oracle.com/software/products/database/oracle10g/index.html\nNOTE: To install a Oracle Database 10g (without RAC) you only need to download\nthe database file ship.db.lnx32.cpio.gz, or 10201_database_linux_x86_64.cpio \netc.\nCompute a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) checksum for the downloaded files and\ncompare the checksum numbers against the numbers posted on OTN's website. For\nexample:cksum ship.db.lnx32.cpio.gz\n\nUncompress the downloaded file(s):gunzip ship.db.lnx32.cpio.gz\n\nUnpack ship.db.lnx32.cpio:$ cpio -idmv < ship.db.lnx32.cpio\nDisk1/stage/Components/oracle.server/10.1.0.3.0/1\nDisk1/stage/Components/oracle.server/10.1.0.3.0\nDisk1/stage/Components/oracle.server\nDisk1/stage/Components/oracle.tg/10.1.0.3.0/1/DataFiles\nDisk1/stage/Components/oracle.tg/10.1.0.3.0/1\nDisk1/stage/Components/oracle.tg/10.1.0.3.0\nDisk1/stage/Components/oracle.tg\nDisk1/stage/Components/oracle.assistants.dbca/10.1.0.3.0/1/DataFiles/doc.3.1.jar\nDisk1/stage/Components/oracle.assistants.dbca/10.1.0.3.0/1/DataFiles/class.jar\n...\n\nI executed the following command to burn the Disk1  directory on a CD:# mkisofs -r Disk1 | cdrecord -v dev=0,0,0 speed=20 -\n\n(Drives' speed varies; you can get the dev numbers when you execute cdrecord\n-scanbus).\nNote that 10g R2 won't fit on a single CD since it has over 780MB.Checking\nMemory and Swap Space\nOracle says that the system must have at least 512MB of RAM and 1GB of swap\nspace or twice the size of RAM. And for systems with more than 2 GB of RAM, the\nswap space can be between one and two times the size of RAM. You might also want\nto check out Sizing Swap Space.\nFor test sake I tried to install an Oracle Database 10g (Type: General Purpose\nDatabase) on a little PC with 256MB of RAM and 1 GB of swap space. I was able to\nget a 10g database up and running on this little PC without a problem.\nTo check the size of physical memory, execute:grep MemTotal /proc/meminfo\n\nTo check the size of swap space, execute:grep SwapTotal /proc/meminfo\n\nYou also can add temporary swap space to your system by creating a temporary\nswap file instead of using a raw device. Here is the procedure:su - root\ndd if=/dev/zero of=tmpswap bs=1k count=900000\nchmod 600 tmpswap\nmkswap tmpswap\nswapon tmpswap\n\nTo disable the temporary swap space execute the following commands:su - root\nswapoff tmpswap\nrm tmpswap\n\nChecking /tmp Space\nAccording to Oracle's documentation, the Oracle Universal Installer (OUI)\nrequires up to 400 MB of free space in the /tmp  directory. But OUI checks if \n/tmp  is only greater than 80 MB.\nTo check the space in /tmp, run:$ df /tmp\n\nIf you do not have enough space in the /tmp  filesystem, you can temporarily\ncreate a tmp  directory in another filesystem. Here is how you can do this:su - root\nmkdir /<AnotherFilesystem>/tmp\nchown root.root /<AnotherFilesystem>/tmp\nchmod 1777 /<AnotherFilesystem>/tmp\nexport TEMP=/<AnotherFilesystem>           # used by Oracle\nexport TMPDIR=/<AnotherFilesystem>         # used by Linux programs like the linker \"ld\"\n\nWhen you are done with the Oracle installation, shutdown Oracle and remove the\ntemporary /tmp  directory:su - root\nrmdir /<AnotherFilesystem>/tmp\nunset TEMP\nunset TMPDIR\n\nChecking Software Packages (RPMs)\nGeneral\nBefore you install an Oracle Database 10g you need to check the system for\nrequired RPMs. On my systems I usually install a minimum list of RPMs which\nusually requires the installation of additional packages for Oracle databases. \nAlways ensure to use the latest RPMs and kernels!For 10g R2 (32-bit) on RHEL 4 x86, the document Oracle Database Release Notes\n10g Release 2 (10.2) for Linux x86\n[http://download-east.oracle.com/docs/html/B15659_03/toc.htm]  lists the\nfollowing required package versions or higher:\n\n  binutils-2.15.92.0.2-10.EL4\n  compat-db-4.1.25-9\n  control-center-2.8.0-12\n  gcc-3.4.3-9.EL4\n  gcc-c++-3.4.3-9.EL4\n  glibc-2.3.4-2\n  glibc-common-2.3.4-2\n  gnome-libs-1.4.1.2.90-44.1\n  libstdc++-3.4.3-9.EL4\n  libstdc++-devel-3.4.3-9.EL4\n  make-3.80-5\n  pdksh-5.2.14-30\n  sysstat-5.0.5-1\n  xscreensaver-4.18-5.rhel4.2\n\nAlso ensure to install the libaio-0.3.96  RPM or a newer version! Otherwise the\nOUI prerequisite check will fail.\nTo check the RPMs, run:\n\n  rpm -q binutils compat-db control-center gcc gcc-c++ glibc glibc-common gnome-libs \\\n         libstdc++ libstdc++-devel make pdksh sysstat xscreensaver libaio\n\n10g R2 on RHEL AS 4 (x86)\nOn my RHEL AS 4 x86  system I had to install the following RPMs and dependencies\nto meet the software requirements:\n\n   rpm -Uvh gcc-3.4.4-2.i386.rpm \\\n            gcc-c++-3.4.4-2.i386.rpm \\\n            libstdc++-devel-3.4.4-2.i386.rpm \\\n            glibc-devel-2.3.4-2.13.i386.rpm \\\n            glibc-headers-2.3.4-2.13.i386.rpm \\\n            glibc-kernheaders-2.4-9.1.98.EL.i386.rpm\n\n   rpm -Uvh gnome-libs-1.4.1.2.90-44.1.i386.rpm \\\n            compat-db-4.1.25-9.i386.rpm \\\n            ORBit-0.5.17-14.i386.rpm \\\n            gtk+-1.2.10-33.i386.rpm \\\n            imlib-1.9.13-23.i386.rpm \\\n            libpng10-1.0.16-1.i386.rpm \\\n            gdk-pixbuf-0.22.0-16.el4.i386.rpm \\\n            libungif-4.1.3-1.i386.rpm \\\n            alsa-lib-1.0.6-5.RHEL4.i386.rpm \\\n            audiofile-0.2.6-1.i386.rpm \\\n            esound-0.2.35-2.i386.rpm\n\n   rpm -Uvh sysstat-5.0.5-1.i386.rpm\n\n   rpm -Uvh libaio-0.3.103-3.i386.rpm\n\n   rpm -Uvh xorg-x11-deprecated-libs-6.8.2-1.EL.13.20.i386.rpm\n\n   rpm -Uvh compat-libstdc++-33-3.2.3-47.3.i386.rpm\n\nI don't know why the control-center  RPM and the xscreensaver  RPM are listed as\nrequirements. On my system I did not install these RPMs since I'm against\ninstalling desktop stuff on servers. When I installed 10g R2 I did not\nexperience any problems when these RPMs were missing. When you want to install \ncontrol-center  RPM and the xscreensaver, then have fun. The list can be very\nlong with all the dependencies like gnome-desktop, cdrecord  etc..\n\nChecking Kernel Parameters\nTo see all kernel parameters, execute:su - root\nsysctl -a\n\nFor Oracle10g, the following kernel parameters have to be set to values greater\nthan or equal to the recommended values which can be changed in the proc \nfilesystem:shmmax  = 2147483648     (To verify, execute: cat /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax)\nshmmni  = 4096           (To verify, execute: cat /proc/sys/kernel/shmmni)\nshmall  = 2097152        (To verify, execute: cat /proc/sys/kernel/shmall)   (for 10g R1)\nshmmin  = 1              (To verify, execute: ipcs -lm |grep \"min seg size\")\nshmseg  = 10             (It's hardcoded in the kernel - the default is much higher)\nsemmsl  = 250            (To verify, execute: cat /proc/sys/kernel/sem | awk '{print $1}')\n\nsemmns  = 32000          (To verify, execute: cat /proc/sys/kernel/sem | awk '{print $2}')\n\nsemopm  = 100            (To verify, execute: cat /proc/sys/kernel/sem | awk '{print $3}')\n\nsemmni  = 128            (To verify, execute: cat /proc/sys/kernel/sem | awk '{print $4}')\n\n\nfile-max = 65536         (To verify, execute: cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max)\n\n\nip_local_port_range = 1024 65000\n\n(To verify, execute: cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range)\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: Do not change the value of any kernel parameter on a system where it is\nalready higher than listed as minimum requirement.\n\nOracle also recommends to set the local port range ip_local_port_range  for\noutgoing messages to \"1024 65000\" which is needed for high-usage systems. This\nkernel parameter defines the local port range for TCP and UDP traffic to choose\nfrom.\nI added the following lines to the /etc/sysctl.conf  file which is used during\nthe boot process:\n\nkernel.shmmax=2147483648\nkernel.sem=250 32000 100 128\nfs.file-max=65536\nnet.ipv4.ip_local_port_range=1024 65000\n\nAdding these lines to the /etc/sysctl.conf  file will cause the system to change\nthese kernel parameters after each boot using the /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit  script\nwhich is invoked by /etc/inittab. But in order that these new added lines or\nsettings in /etc/sysctl.conf  become effective immediately, execute the\nfollowing command:\n\nsu - root\nsysctl -p\n\nSizing Disk Space for Oracle10g\nOracle says that about 2.5 GB of disk space should be reserved for the Oracle\nsoftware  on Linux.\nWhen I did an Oracle 10g Release 1 (10.1.0.3.0) \"General Purpose Database\"\ninstallation (not including any software from the Oracle Database 10g Companion\nCD), the Oracle software  used about 1.3 GB of disk space, and the preconfigured\n\"General Purpose Database\" (datafiles, etc.) used about 710 MB of disk space.$ du -m -s /u01\n1963    /u01\n$ du -m -s /u01/app/oracle/oradata\n720     /u01/app/oracle/oradata\n\nIf you also install additional software from the Oracle Database 10g Companion\nCD, then add at least 1 GB of free disk space.\nSo if you install Oracle10g Enterprise Edition and additional software from the\nOracle Database 10g Companion CD, then you need about 2.5 GB of disk for the\nOracle software. And if you also want to add a preconfigured database on the\nsame filesystem, make sure to add another 1 GB of disk space.\nNOTE: If you don't put Oracle10g on a separate filesystems, then make sure the\nroot filesystem \"/\" has enough disk space. You can check the free space of the\nroot filesystem with the following command:df -h /\n\nUsing Automatic Storage Management (ASM)\nFor more information on installing and configuring ASM, see Installing and\nConfiguring Automatic Storage Management (ASM) and Disks. And for information on\nhow to make use of ASM disk groups when running OUI, see Installing Oracle\nDatabase 10g with Real Application Cluster (RAC).Creating Oracle User Accounts\nTo create the oracle  account and groups, execute the following commands:su - root\ngroupadd dba          # group of users to be granted SYSDBA system privilege\ngroupadd oinstall     # group owner of Oracle files\nuseradd -c \"Oracle software owner\" -g oinstall -G dba oracle\npasswd oracle\n\nFor more information on the \"oinstall\"  group account, see When to use\n\"OINSTALL\" group during install of oracle.Setting Shell Limits for the Oracle\nUser\nMost shells like Bash provide control over various resources like the maximum\nallowable number of open file descriptors or the maximum number of processes\navailable to a user. For more information on ulimit  for the Bash shell, see man\nbash  and search for ulimit.\nIf you just install a small test database, then you might be ok with the current\nsettings (note that the limits very often vary). But for (larger) production\ndatabases, you should increase the following shell limits to the following\nvalues recommended by Oracle:nofile = 65536     (To verify, execute: ulimit -n)\nnproc  = 16384     (To verify, execute: ulimit -u)\n\nThe nofile  option denotes the maximum number of open file descriptors, and \nnproc  denotes the maximum number of processes available to a single user.\nTo see all shell limits, execute:ulimit -a\n\nThe following procedures/links show how to increase these parameters for the \noracle  user account:\nFor more information on nofile  and how to increase the limit, see Setting\nLimits for the Maximum Number of Open File Descriptors for the Oracle User. Even\nthough this procedure was written for Oracle9i on RHAS 2.1, it also applies to\nOracle10g on RHEL AS 2.1, RHEL AS 3, and other versions.\nFor more information on nproc  and how to increase the limit, see Setting\nLimits\nfor the Maximum Number of Processes for the Oracle User. Even though this\nprocedure was written for Oracle9i on RHAS 2.1, it also applies to Oracle10g on\nRHEL AS 2.1, RHEL AS 3, and other versions.Creating Oracle Directories\nFor Oracle10g you only need to create the directory for $ORACLE_BASE:su - root\nmkdir -p /u01/app/oracle\nchown oracle.oinstall /u01/app/oracle\n\nBut if you want to comply with Oracle's Optimal Flexible Architecture (OFA),\nthen you don't want to place the database files in the /u01  directory but in\nanother directory/filesystem/disk like /u02. This is not a requirement but if\nyou want to comply with OFA, then you might want to create the following\ndirectories as well:su - root\nmkdir -p /u02/oradata/orcl\nchown oracle.oinstall /u02/oradata/orcl\n\nIn this example, \"orcl\" stands for the name of the database which will also be\nthe name of the instance. This is typically the case for single instance\ndatabases.Optimal Flexible Architecture (OFA) for 10g R1 (10.1.0.2)\nThe OFA standard is a guideline created by Oracle to ensure reliable Oracle\ninstallations. For Oracle 10g Database, the OFA recommended Oracle home path has\nchanged.\nThe home path for the first 10g (10.1.0) database installation on a system would\nbe:  /u01/app/oracle/product/10.1.0/db_1\n\nIf you would install a second Oracle 10g Database 10g (10.1.0) on the same\nsystem, the Oracle home directory would be as follows:  /u01/app/oracle/product/10.1.0/db_2\n\nIf the Oracle10g software is not owned by the user oracle  but by the user\n\"oraowner\", then the path of the Oracle home directory would be:  /u01/app/oraowner/product/10.1.0/db_1\n  /u01/app/oraowner/product/10.1.0/db_2\n\nThe standard directory name for Oracle10g is \"app\":  /u01/app/oracle/product/10.1.0/db_1\n\nOracle recommends to use mount points such as /u01, /u02, etc. which complies\nwith the OFA guidelines. But others can be used, for example:  /disk_1/app/oracle/product/10.1.0/db_1\n\nThe subtree for database files not stored in ASM disk groups should be named as\nfollows:  /u02/oradata/<db_name_1>\n  /u02/oradata/<db_name_2>\n  /u03/oradata/<db_name_1>\n  /u03/oradata/<db_name_2>\n\nThe mount point /u01  should be used for the Oracle software only. /u02, /u03, \n/u04  etc. should be used for the database files. The db_name  stands for the \nDB_NAME  initialization parameter which is typically the same as the SID name\nfor single instance databases.Setting Oracle Environments\nSince the Oracle Universal Installer (OUI) \"runInstaller\" is run from the oracle \n account, some environment variables must be configured for this account before\nOUI is started.\nExecute the following commands for the Bash shell which is the default shell on\nRed Hat Linux (to verify your shell run: echo $SHELL):su - oracle\nexport ORACLE_BASE=/u01/app/oracle\nexport ORACLE_SID=orcl\n\nNOTE: If ORACLE_BASE  is used, then Oracle recommends that you don't set the \nORACLE_HOME  environment variable but that you choose the default path suggested\nby the OUI. You can set and use ORACLE_HOME  after you finished running OUI.\nAlso, the environment variables ORACLE_HOME  and TNS_ADMIN  should not be set.\nIf you've already set these environment variables, you can unset them by running\nthe following commands:unset ORACLE_HOME\nunset TNS_ADMIN\n\nTo have these environment variables set automatically each time you login as \noracle, you can add these environment variables to the ~oracle/.bash_profile \nfile which is the user startup file for the Bash shell on Red Hat Linux. To do\nthis you could simply copy/paste the following commands to make these settings\npermanent for your oracle's Bash shell:su - oracle\ncat >> ~oracle/.bash_profile << EOF\nexport ORACLE_BASE=/u01/app/oracle\nexport ORACLE_SID=orcl\nEOF\n\nInstalling Oracle10g\nInstalling Oracle10g on a Remote Linux Server\nIf you don't install Oracle on your local system but on a remote server, then\nyou need to relink X to your local desktop. The easiest way to do this is to use\nthe \"X11 forwarding\" feature of ssh. This means that you don't have to run xhost \n and set the DISPLAY  environment variable.\nHere is an example how to make use of the \"X11 forward\" feature of ssh. Simply\nrun the following command from your local desktop:$ ssh -X oracle@oracle_remote_server_name\n\nNow when you try to run any GUI tool on the remote server, it will automatically\nbe relinked to your local desktop. If this is not working, verify that the \nForwardX11  setting is not set to \"no\" in /etc/ssh/ssh_config  on the remote\nserver:su - root\n# grep ForwardX11 /etc/ssh/ssh_config | grep -v \"^#\"\n        ForwardX11 yes\n#\n\nIf you are using telnet, however, you will have to set DISPLAY  manually, see\narticle Starting runInstaller  for more information.Starting Oracle Universal\nInstaller\nInsert the Oracle CD that contains the image of the downloaded file \nship.db.lnx32.cpio, or change to the directory that contains the image directory\n Disk1.\nIf you install Oracle10g from a CD, mount the CD by running the following\ncommands in another terminal:\n\nsu - root\nmount /media/cdrom\n\nBefore you execute runInstaller, make sure the Oracle environment variables are\nset, see Setting Oracle Environments. You can verify the settings by running the\n set  command:\n\nsu - oracle\noracle$ set\n\nTo execute runInstaller  from the mounted CD, run the following command as the \noracle  user:\n\noracle$ /media/cdrom/runInstaller\n\nUsing Oracle Universal Installer (OUI)\nThe following example shows how to install x86 Oracle 10g Release 1 Database\nSoftware and a \"General Purpose\" database:\n(Note, the screens and questions will look different if you install 10g R2 or\n64-bit 10g R1 database)\n\n- Welcome Screen:\n\n        - Basic Installation:       Checked it which is the default\n        - Oracle Home Location:     Use default: /u01/app/oracle/product/10.1.0/db_1\n        - Installation Type:        I used the default: Enterprise Edition\n        - UNIX DBA Group:           Use default: dba\n        - Create Starter Databases: I checked it for this example which is the default\n        - Global Database Name:     orcl\n        - Database password:        password for SYS, SYSTEM, SYSMAN, and DBSNMP\n\n        - Advanced Installation:    For this article I did not check it\nClick Next\n\n- Specify Inventory directory and credentials:\n        - Full path of the inventory directory: Use default: /u01/app/oracle/oraInventory\n        - Specify Operating System group name:  Use default: oinstall\nClick Next\n\n- A window pops up to run the orainstRoot.sh script:\n        Run the script in another terminal:\n            su - root\n            # /u01/app/oracle/oraInventory/orainstRoot.sh\n            Creating the Oracle inventory pointer file (/etc/oraInst.loc)\n            Changing groupname of /u01/app/oracle/oraInventory to oinstall.\n            #\n        Click Continue\n\n- Product-specific Prerequisite Checks:\n        Verify that all checks have been passed.\n        Make sure that the status of each Check is set to \"Succeeded\".\n        On RHEL AS 4 ignore the warnings for binutils, gcc, and openmotif and proceed.\n        Note that the \"Retry\" button doesn't work after you fixed one of the failed checks.\nClick Next\n\n- Select Database Configuration:\n        I selected \"General Purpose\".\nClick Next\n\n- Specify Database Configuration Options:\n       - Global Database Name: I used \"orcl\".\n       - SID: I used \"orcl\".\nClick Next\n\n- Select Database Management Option:\n       I selected \"Use Database Control for Database Management\".\nClick Next\n\n- Specify Database File Storage Option: I selected \"File System\".\n       - File System     - Specify Database file location: /u01/app/oracle/oradata/\n                           If you want to comply with OFA, you should another  mount point\n                           than '/u01', e.g. /u02/oradata.\nClick Next\n\n- Specify Backup and Recovery Options:\n         For my test installation I selected \"Do no enable Automated Backups\".\nClick Next\n\n- Specify Database Schema Passwords:\n        Make sure that the password(s) don't start with a digit number!

The bulk of it starts about 3.7 million miles (6 million km) away from the planet and extends outward another 7.4 million miles (12 million km).\\n\\nIts diameter is equivalent to 300 Saturns lined up side to side. And its entire volume can hold one billion Earths, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory said late Tuesday.\\n\\n\\\"This is one supersized ring,\\\" said Anne Verbiscer, an astronomer at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville.\\n\\nVerbiscer and two others are authors of a paper about the discovery published Wednesday in the journal Nature.\\n\\nThe obvious question: Why did it take scientists so long to discover something so massive?\\n\\nThe ring is made up of ice and dust particles that are so far apart that \\\"if you were to stand in the ring, you wouldn't even know it,\\\" Verbiscer said in a statement.\\n\\nAlso, Saturn doesn't receive a lot of sunlight, and the rings don't reflect much visible light.\\n\\nBut the cool dust -- about 80 Kelvin (minus 316 degrees Fahrenheit) -- glows with thermal radiation. NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, used to spot the ring, picked up on the heat.\\nOne of Saturn's moons, Phoebe, orbits within the ring. As Phoebe collides with comets, it kicks up planetary dust.

If not us then who is going to this.\\n\\nThe next being who is going to conduct the investigations and how can it me made sure that the investigations are unbiased, if the corrupt are able to coarse the existing investigation agencies, I am sure that this would be no exception, and how would the timeline of one year for investigation and one year for trail be met? where are the proposed changes for the judicial systems which would allow this timeline to come into existence ? And what would be the appeal process ? the officer/politician would always say that they have done nothing wrong and would want to appeal, In this scenario are they re investigated or would the initial investigation and judgement would be held authoritative ?\\n\\nAnd i would not even try to address the point of recovery of loss from convicted as this seems too much hypothetical, good luck trying to get back money from A.Raja or Suresh Kalmadi.\\n\\nAnd if Lokpal would be approached for every other issue, how is it going to address the huge list of complaints that it is going to receive ? again we would be ending up in a system which looks like our judicial system.\\n\\nAgain coming back to the process of selection of members this is a point which has not been addressed to in any of the discussions that i have seen. There is no guarantee that even after all the other anti corruption agencies are merged this  institution would independent enough or that the people in this institution cannot be influenced, so how can this be addressed ?\\n\\nThe very first counter argument that i always receive is that this a begging step and and we would have to start somewhere. But if we are fighting for it so passionately why settle for first step why not for more? , I welcome you to join this discussion and educate me if I am wrong but I still don't see light at the end of the dark tunnel of corruption we are in.\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]],\"ghostVersion\":\"3.0\"}",

                        "plaintext": "I have been watching closely on what was happening with the entire process of\nfasts, demonstrations over Lokpal and Janlokpal bill, I went through the bullet\npoints of Janlokpal bill and began wondering, how does this bill help in curbing\ncorruption or for that matter bringing back the black money back to India, I\nhave seen so many people get behind this movement most of them not knowing what\nthe content of the bill is and how does it improve their lives, I know that\npeople are fed up of corruption and want it rooted out but there is a lot more\nto this than just a bill.\nLet us first discuss what Janlokpal bill wants to achieve and my doubts and\ncounter arguments on why this would not be enough, All this keeping in mind that\nthat I am not against the bill.\n\nThese are salient features of the bill (taken from\nhttp://www.indiaagainstcorruption.org/salient.html)\n\n * An institution called LOKPAL at the centre and LOKAYUKTA in each state will\n   be set up\n * Like Supreme Court and Election Commission, they will be completely\n   independent of the governments. No minister or bureaucrat will be able to\n   influence their investigations.\n * Cases against corrupt people will not linger on for years anymore:\n   Investigations in any case will have to be completed in one year. Trial\n   should be completed in next one year so that the corrupt politician, officer\n   or judge is sent to jail within two years.\n * The loss that a corrupt person caused to the government will be recovered at\n   the time of conviction.\n * How will it help a common citizen:If any work of any citizen is not done in\n   prescribed time in any government office, Lokpal will impose financial\n   penalty on guilty officers, which will be given as compensation to the\n   complainant.\n * So, you could approach Lokpal if your ration card or passport or voter card\n   is not being made or if police is not registering your case or any other work\n   is not being done in prescribed time. Lokpal will have to get it done in a\n   month’s time. You could also report any case of corruption to Lokpal like\n   ration being siphoned off, poor quality roads been constructed or panchayat\n   funds being siphoned off. Lokpal will have to complete its investigations in\n   a year, trial will be over in next one year and the guilty will go to jail\n   within two years.\n * But won’t the government appoint corrupt and weak people as Lokpal members?\n   That won’t be possible because its members will be selected by judges,\n   citizens and constitutional authorities and not by politicians, through a\n   completely transparent and participatory process.\n * What if some officer in Lokpal becomes corrupt?The entire functioning of\n   Lokpal/ Lokayukta will be completely transparent. Any complaint against any\n   officer of Lokpal shall be investigated and the officer dismissed within two\n   months.\n * What will happen to existing anti-corruption agencies?CVC, departmental\n   vigilance and anti-corruption branch of CBI will be merged into Lokpal.\n   Lokpal will have complete powers and machinery to independently investigate\n   and prosecute any officer, judge or politician.\n * It will be the duty of the Lokpal to provide protection to those who are\n   being victimized for raising their voice against corruption.\n\nSo we are basically setting up a new institution which is supposed to be\nindependent, but how can this institution be independent, how would the members\nof the committee be appointed, it is always mentioned that the committee would\nbe comprised of eminent people, but who would the judge of this, we are the\npeople who knowingly elect so called corrupt people into parliament, so should\nwe be responsible for appointing people ? If not us then who is going to this.\nThe next being who is going to conduct the investigations and how can it me made\nsure that the investigations are unbiased, if the corrupt are able to coarse the\nexisting investigation agencies, I am sure that this would be no exception, and\nhow would the timeline of one year for investigation and one year for trail be\nmet? where are the proposed changes for the judicial systems which would allow\nthis timeline to come into existence ? And what would be the appeal process ?\nthe officer/politician would always say that they have done nothing wrong and\nwould want to appeal, In this scenario are they re investigated or would the\ninitial investigation and judgement would be held authoritative ?\n\nAnd i would not even try to address the point of recovery of loss from convicted\nas this seems too much hypothetical, good luck trying to get back money from\nA.Raja or Suresh Kalmadi.\n\nAnd if Lokpal would be approached for every other issue, how is it going to\naddress the huge list of complaints that it is going to receive ? again we would\nbe ending up in a system which looks like our judicial system.\n\nAgain coming back to the process of selection of members this is a point which\nhas not been addressed to in any of the discussions that i have seen.

He has done nothing to add to the \"Been there Done that\"\nsection of his profile, But when he is not able to find a negative which is\nsupposed to go on the cover of the magazine, he embarks on a journey which takes\nhim to places.The movie is based on a short story by James Thurber, Ben Stiller\nalso gets into the director seat, while the premise is great the movie fails to\ndeliver all that it could, I am not saying that the movie is bad, its quite\ngood, but its potential was far greater, Ben Stiller does know how to extract a\nlaugh out of the audience but you fail to get attached to the lead character,\nThere are some moments of greatness in the movie Ben stiller is a wonderful\ndirector, Tropic Thunder proved that but this one falls short.\n\nThe Cinematography is wonderful and Stuart Dryburgh would surely be nominated\nfor Oscar, for the clean cut visuals of Iceland, Greenland and the Himalayas,\nThe locations and the visuals are amazing.\nThe other actors also fit in nicely to the movie, Sean Penn in his small\nappearence is also good\nThe movie has one of the best renditions of David Bowie's song Major Tom, and\nthe one line I will always remember from the movie\n\nBeautiful things don't seek attention\n\nCome out of the movie wanting to escape from your life and travel\n\n\n\nAnother one for 2014, waiting for the hatrick",

Parts of this is supposedly based on real life events\\nWhile the premise is set, the movie is much more about the human relation and the chemistry between the lead charectes, Jennifer Lawrence plays Rosalyn, Irwin's Wife who is unpredictable.\\nThe movie takes light hearted approach but does go down to the emotions. The movie stats of a bit slow, but once it starts its like a wonderfull candy which you can't get enough of.\\n\\nThe performances by everyone is very good, Its more the case of everyone is so good that you can't pick the best of them. David O Russel manages to extarct the right amount of acting from all of them including Jeremy Rener whom i consider to be a Cameo role and from Louis CK who plays Richie's boss. \\n\\nThe movie does some to drag on a little bit (not that you notice it), and some odd style of narration by actors which I did not like.

While he is pitched to be the prime explorer, him\ncoming to terms with own reality somehow feels rushed, corny and somewhat\ndownright bizarre.\n\nI do respect Jonathan and Christopher Nolan when it comes to screenplay and\nstory development, but i really do feel that the movie needed a little more time\nin Oven to come out fully baked.",

There was a lot of learning and lot of sleepless nights during this.\\nIn this post, I would like to share what we chose to  build the E-commerce Platform.\\n\\n##Brief\\n\\nThe brief was to build a rewards platform which allows you to redeem your earned points for products, flights, hotels, movies etc.\\nThe platform would act as an aggregator and should be extensible to be configured for different banks or loyalty platforms and skinned accordingly. The platform should also be able to switch providers on the fly.\\nInfrastructure wise the platform should run on CentOS on AWS.\\n\\n##Technology Choices\\n\\nWith the Brief also came the question on technology stack. While we as a company had dabbled on many stacks, we wanted a definite ability to meet timelines and comfort of developers and tools. Add to it the fact that it needed to run on *nix, It came down to Nodejs and PHP. From that point onwards it was a no-brainer, and as the title already spoiled it NodeJS would be used.\\n\\n###Tooling\\n\\nWell, we all know how stupid javascript can be or more importantly how stupid developers can be when using javascript. We wanted to use something which we can then compile down to javascript so that we can have some sanity and some development time checks.\\nCoffeeScript and Typescript were the choices and the latter was the clear winner, Its straightforward for Javascript developers and has enough goodies for doing compile-time checks to make sure were not being utterly stupid. \\nThen came the code editor/ debugger. While we were using Visual Studio for our earlier projects. We recently moved to Ubuntu on a number of developers PCs and wanted something which can run on Linux. Sublime Editor + Node-Debug was the preferred choice, but something new came along, Visual Studio Code from Microsoft, if you haven't been living in a cave you might have already come across this and what started out with one developer quickly spread through the team. We jumped in when VSCode was at 0.3 and we  have really liked the direction the editor has taken.\\n And a small shout out to Paw on Mac which has been my lifesaver so many numbers of times.\\n\\n###Databases\\nFrom the outset, we knew that going to a single database approach would not be a great solution. So we took the hybrid Approach\\n\\n####MongoDB\\nThis fit it perfectly for slow changing data like Product Data or Hotel Inventory Information. Each entity was independent and had very little joins with others. Full-Text Search + GeoLocation Search were added advantages\\n\\n####MySQL\\nFor the transactional data, we felt that a good relational database made more sense while what ended up with is not that relational. Very few Searches are performed on this database and more importantly it has 1-to-1 read-only replica which are used for querying and reporting purposes.\\n\\n###Caching:Redis\\nThe Central API talks to several API Providers and we also wanted to implement the cache for API responses so as to cheat on the performance a bit. Redis was a perfect fit. It is also used for noncritical caches and is configured to be No Disk Write mode.\\n\\n\\n###Frameworks\\nThe question was whether we handcraft a framework or start with an existing one for the API gateway. I dabbled in a few but at the end Loopback came out ahead because of its sheer simplicity when it came to creating REST-APIs, As mentioned earlier one of the briefs was to keep Vendors switchable so we wanted to build a common API definition which the client applications could use without worrying about the vendor and the implementation mechanisms. Loopback actually had tons of additional features like a soap adapter (which was not used).\\n\\n####Web Application\\n\\n#####Server: ExpressJS + nginx\\n\\nWhile NodeJS is still considered new in enterprises. It has already proved itself in terms of performance and being lightweight. We chose ExpressJS with Handlebars templating as that was probably the easiest in terms of frameworks.\\n\\n######Client: KnockoutJS\\n\\nFor the browser where we wanted dynamic experiences for the user, we build mini-apps usings KnockoutJS and Jquery. ReactJS is slowly being introduced.\\n\\n####Audit + Reporing\\n\\n#####ELK Stack\\nAs the applications built would be for banks and loyalty programs Audit Trail and Logging were of extreme importance and ELK Stack (ElasticSearch+LogStash+Kibana for the uninitiated) fit right in. Using Kibana we were also able to create basic dashboards of metrics which was not just for operational monitoring but also business use case.\\n\\n####Mobile Apps \\nWhile we are not building mobile apps ourselves, Most apps are built as native but there is one client application which is just a web view wrapper around the responsive website.\\n\\n###Final Stack\\n\\n![Stack Overview](/content/images/2015/11/Stack.png)\\n\\n###Asides\\n\\nWhile the following are not high-level frameworks or components, I could not complete this post without mentioning them\\n\\n#### async.js : Way out of Callback Hell\\nIf you have used or understood how NodeJS functions you know what a callback hell is (it is just a search away). But async was a life saver, If there is one library which was most used in the entire development it is async with its [waterfall],[map],[parallel] methods we have been able to write code which actually is understandable.\\n\\n####NewRelic : DevOps Monitoring made simple\\nNewRelic is one of those things that you must have in your application. Monitoring Production apps are always difficult and NewRelic was the answer to finding the pain points in performance in production.\\n\\n####Gulp: Not used for what you think\\nGulp is an excellent task runner and we have used it not just for the web-application but have also made it an integral part of the tool-chain in build and release management.\\n\\n\\n##Performance\\nWhile all of the above is talk what matters at the end (other than Sales) is Performance \\nSo using a Medium Instance for the API Server and two Load balanced Micro Instances for web application server The following is average response times and percentages for the last 2 months \\n\\n- API Server: 246ms.\\n- Web Server: 143ms.\\n- Overall Error % : 4 %\\n- Application Error % : 0.5% (Excluding 3rd Party API Errors)\\n\\n![User Visit Spread](/content/images/2015/11/IMG_0639-1.png)\\n\\n---\\n###What is Missing\\nWhile we are still building more applications, we are also missing some integral pieces to make the solution complete.\\n\\n- Automated Deployment from GIT.\\n- Automated Environment Management \\n- Dashboarding and Reporting for Business Users.
