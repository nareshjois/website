I just saw a cool video of video object manipulation that adobe is dabbling about, things like drawing in a video seems so simple and achiveable for people like us, check out the cool video after the break, as he says at the end, there is no guarantee of when this becomes a commercial product reality, but i certainly have my fingers crossed for this.
