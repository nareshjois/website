India on Wednesday, September 23rd 2009 launched a second satellite to study oceans. The cube-shaped Oceansat-2 will monitor the interaction between oceans and the atmosphere, as part of climate studies, according to the country's main space agency. The satellite, launched from India's southeast coast, carried six nanosatellites from European universities as auxiliary payloads, said the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). It also is equipped with two solar panels projecting from its sides, for generating power and charging batteries. India says it has the world's largest constellation of remote-sensing satellites -16, including Oceansat-2. They produce images for uses such as agriculture, rural development, water resources, forestry and disaster management.
