In all the examples out there to see the SQL generated by a LINQ2SQL query console.out is used, but to monitor the SQL in a debug window we need to write a special text writer implementation
<script src="https://gist.github.com/nareshjois/7896601.js"></script>

The you can use
`datacontext.log = new DebuggerWriter();`
