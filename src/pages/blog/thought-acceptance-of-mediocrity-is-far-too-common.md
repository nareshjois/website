I was always taught to be self-critical, the idea being that if you develop the habit you will always make sure that you'll work on bettering yourself. I would still like to believe that this is one of the best possible ways of improving one self. 
But as I have gotten to know more people and work with a few of them, I was in for a shock on the level of disconnect they have about the quality of their work, This isn't the first time that i have come across people like this, but the percentage of this has certainly increased over the past few years.
I had observed this in people earlier, but i had always ignored it thinking that this is an one off situation and they would have been better if the situation was different.
