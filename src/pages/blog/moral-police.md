We have all been some how affected by the so called moral police at least here in India. Each and everyday some people who think they are torch bearers of Indian Culture take upon themselves to protect the system. Here you are at one hand talking about development and open mindedness and on the other you go and completely do something which makes us look like we are from ancient ages (I will have to correct that, even then people were open to depict lot of things as creative freedom) But today , you are not allowed to express yourself in anyway, somebody will always be at your throat to actually stop you at the middle and make you scream at the top of your voice that there is something wrong with this system,
