The inevitable bar-raising of low end tech now sees even crapcams rocking semi-advanced features spendier users have enjoyed for, well, nigh on years. Minox's new DC-7011 has a 2.5-inch LCD, 3x optical zoom, and 7 megapixel sensor, USB 2.0, PictBridge support, even a top-mounted mode wheel -- yet still somehow manages to look like like something you wouldn't pay more than $75(Rs.3750) for. My advice to you: you probably shouldn't.
