Kodak have quietly added the new Kodak Easyshare C653 to their website. The C653 is an entry-level digital camera with 6 megapixels, 3x optical zoom lens equivalent to 36â€“108mm, 2.4 inch LCD screen, digital IS using anti-blur mode to reduce blur caused by camera or subject movement, and 20 program scene and 3 color modes.

Now you might start thinking why the hell did I put this on my website Well the reason is simple, it just costs Rs.5,500 ($125)
