WPF has been here for quite a while now and i done some basic projects on wpf, but for the last two months i had the opportunity to completely work on WPF, not just WPF but also used Linq2SQL as the base for the complete application, wet my hands with ADO.net Entity Model and lot of work in Expression Blend,
The software was for KPCC and it an complete automation and information management system for them, I will not reveal much more, but a few screens which are not part of the NDA have been posted here,
