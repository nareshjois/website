Well the spanking new vista is here and I know most of us had refrained from upgrading waiting for Vista to arrive. As Vista is here I thought it might be a good idea for upgrading and get a new system, The rates mentioned here are steet prices, I think you have a hunt a little bit for products, but its certainly worth it. So here we go

**Processor: AMD Athlon64 X2 4000+**

I know all you Intel fanboys out there will say C2D is a better option, but you can never compare price to performance ratio to an AMD. AMD 4000+ is a cheap yet powerful option, Even in terms of gaming it gives a good performance.

<strong>RAM: Transcend 1GB DD2 800 MHz
</strong>

I think this will be enough for most of our puposes.

<strong>Mother Board: Gigabyte GA-M55plus-S3G
</strong>

The reason for choosing this Mother board is simple, This is a nForce 430 chipset board and has a onboard GeForce 6150 graphics controller, for those on a tight budget can skip buying a dedicated graphics card and still a good performance, Vista rates this 3.0 if 64MB is shared video memory, and it also has a PCI-Express slot for expansion for that cool graphics card. It has a 5.1 Channel HD Sound OnBoard. And is Vista Certified.

<strong>Hard Disk: Seagate 200 GB SATA HDD
</strong>

I know this might not be enough for all the videos and music and stuff(you know what I mean), but It is still a good option, and you can record some shows too, but keep in mind if you want to do a lot of recording get a second HDD.

<strong>Graphics Card: XFX GeForce 7600 256MB
</strong>

Should I say anything more??

<strong>Keyboard and Mouse: Logitech cordless Desktop
</strong>

This is the perfect combination of usability and ergonomics, but if you want to use mouse a lot, I suggest you get a wired version cause you cant using those AA batteries which die out in a month.

<strong>TV Tuner :  Haupauge WinTV PVR 150+
</strong>

This TV tuner is certified for Vista, and if you really want get a second one by which you can record one show while watching other.

<strong>Monitor : Viewsonic VA1912W
</strong>

This Monitor is simply great for viewing anything, it a 16:10 display ratio, with 1440x900 resolution with a response time of 5ms and a 500:1 Contrast Ratio. And is Vista Certified.

<strong>Optical Drive : Sony DVD Writer
</strong>

Well this is the cheapest option, it doesn't have Lightscribe but hey how many of us get Lightscribe compatible blank DVDs

<strong>Speakers: Creative Inspire 5.1
</strong>

You cannot go wrong with these speakers, this the best possible speakers within 5k and it is the reason enough

<strong>CPU Casing : Really your choice
</strong>
