While the original 300 wasnt the greatest movie, it had the awesome visuals, stylized fight sequences and good amount of blood splatter, to entice and attract you, 
the next installement in the series tries to take this to the extreme and I would say it fails miserably, 
Too much of time and effort and focus has been put on the blood splatter and stylyzing the sequences that it feels almost comical. 
The story takes place in parallel to the original and its not a lot to mention, 
Noam Murro who takes the directors chair from Zack Snyder manages to show enough blood to make you tired.
The only redeeming feature of the movie is Eva Green, (PS: She looks wonderful)
All of the rating only for Eva Green.
