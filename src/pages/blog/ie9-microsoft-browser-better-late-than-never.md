I am not going to talk much about the new features of IE 9 as I think that too many people have blogged about the same thing, and I thought I would show a nifty littl feature which would make site work like an app, including options like windows 7 jump lists, I will let the Images do the talking.

Top 5 features for Me :
1. Simplified Interface
2. Add On Disabler
3. Download Manager (Finally)
4. Standards Support (CSS3 and HTML5)
5. GPU Rendering
