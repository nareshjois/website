As you might already know I am not a big fan of the Intel Core 2 Duo, but I just could not resist this PC simply because of the form factor, just look at it, it simply has a size of an A4 sized book, hey even my Windows 2003 reference book is bigger, and guess what it can also stand like a Wii, Powered by your choice of dual-core / Celeron M Intel processors, this wee machine also touts Intel's GMA950 integrated graphics set, a hybrid TV tuner for analog / DVB-T reception, SATA hard drive, up to 2GB of DDR2 RAM, 7.1-channel HD audio, FM radio tuner, dual-layer DVD burner, built-in 802.11b/g, PS/2 connectors, DVI output, multi-format flash card reader, an audio input jack, and an IR remote to boot. Notably, it managed to lose the FireWire and S-Video ports found on the X100, but it does boast five USB 2.0 ports in a feeble attempt to compensate. There are available in two versions and while the somewhat stripped X200BA will run you just $972 (Rs.45,000), the beefed-up X200MA will demand at least $1,240(Rs.62,000) depending on options.
