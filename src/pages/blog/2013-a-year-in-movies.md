2013 has been a great year for movies both in terms of release and in terms of variety. I watched a lot of movies this year and here is a list that i can remember, May be I have missed out a few but will add them to the list.

> The 50 movies that I watched on Big Screen

## Captian Philips
Tom Hanks is probably one of the bect actors of this generation and this movie really shows why, Superb story telling mixed with wonderful acting resulted in on the gripping movies of the year, I failed to find a single spot in the movie where i thought this should have been done differently, I know its a feel good movie for Americans which shows how far they can go for a single person, yet the movie really stood out of the crowd.
<br/>
<br/>

## The Conjuring
James Wan's Conjuring made me watch the horror genre again, I was too tired of the blood spatter and gore which had taken over the horror genre, this movie put the scare back in the movie without doing that, A movie that i can recommend everyone to watch.
<br/>
<br/>

## Superman: Man Of Steel
I am a sucker for Superman and I felt that Zack Snyder's more darker version of superman was good. I know that the critics did not agree on this but WTH, I liked it a lot and this movie will stay on my NAS for a long time to come.
<br/>
<br/>

## Thor: The Dark World
After a dissapointment that was Iron Man 3, Marvel needed an comeback and boy did Thor deliver, The first movie was not that great but the second one really bought the punch back into the Superhero movie genre.
<br/>
<br/>

## Pacific Rim
With a cast of relatively unknown actors Guillermo del Toro managed to deliver one of the best action movies of the year, It was also one of the movies that made sure that IMAX was a worthwhile format to watch movies in.
<br/>
<br/>

## Gravity
Space Science Fiction like you have never seen before, Alfonso Cuar√≥n's movie had some great moments, His long pan shots, the silcene of space, the switch to POV shots were all great, also the IMAX format was wonderful. Things got hairy at the end but still loved the movie.
<br/>
<br/>

## Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug
 Lord of the rings were based on great books and the Hobbit series did not have too much work with, while I did not like the first one, the second one did manage to pull of the story, it was a mix of wonderfull storytelling (given you agree to the creative licenses taken) and wonderful direction. P.S: I badly need to visit New Zeland on one of the great walks.
<br/>
<br/>

## The Hunger Games : Catching Fire.
The middle one of what i think is a trilogy, the movie sets up the stage nicely what i am hopful will be a climactic end, The movie by itself was the not the best, but in context of the trilogy it is a good one.
<br/>
<br/>

## Star Trek: Into the Darekness
The thrid movie in this list which is the second of its series, co-incidence ?, Benedict Cumberbatch stole the show in this one, While this was not as good the first one still a good watch, P.S : JJ I know lens flares looks cool but the movie looks like output of a kid who learnt how to do lens flares in AE, Please reduce the them.

## The Worst of the year 
### The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones 
 Why the hell was this movie made, did they really forget in the middle of the movie what they were making or completely forgot the story.The movie was like someone desperately wanting to mess up with the audience.Dude please don't try to make the lead actors brother and sister after you try to make them a romatic couple.
